# Pygame - Snake
A snake game built with python's pygame library.

This snake game was built using python 3.7 and pygame. However I've used an external library called pygame_textinput from a github repository to create the text input, obviously.

I've a few comments there for you to understand the code just enough. There are things like scores and the snake tail (could be removed) to be fixed. Otherwise the game is functional. 

Hopefully this will give you an idea of how pygame works and how you could make your own game. Other than that, I've the assets myself, by hand, yes, so no copyrights, just mine, but feel free to use them as you want.
